Don't be such a wuss
Seoul is mine tonight
Let's rizz up all night
서론이 길었나
“Want to kiss you right now”
I’ll get you all night
나를 소개할게 nice guy,
fresh guy of the night
모두가 네게 말해
better watch out girl
간지러운 나의 목소리
허수아비도 make wavy
타고난 끼가 운명인가 봐
Look at my eyes
Look at my line, my girl
You like it right?
Oh no no no
Look at my eyes
Look at my line, my girl
You like me right?
No no no
They say
I can’t take my eyes off you
미치겠지 시크한 말투
너만의 사람은 어렵구
빨리 말해줘 yes or no no no no
친구들이 파티에 얼굴만
비춰달라네 Sorry
이제 뭐 딱히 재미가 없어서
Nice guy, fresh guy 맞지 right?
안 넘어오고는 못 배긴다니까
섹시한 나의 눈빛에
넘어와 my shawty
Oh baby baby I'm busy tonight
Look at my eyes
Look at my line, my girl
You like it right?
Oh no no no
Look at my eyes
Look at my line, my girl
You like me right?
No no no
망설이지 말고 냉큼 말해봐
You’ll say it “I love you”
Baby baby please
Please don’t go away 할거지?
I want it too
Look at my eyes (Eyes)
Look at my line, my girl
(Line, my girl)
You like it right?
(Come on baby)
Oh no no no (No no no)
Look at my eyes
(Don’t we look lovely?
You know it)
Look at my line, my girl
You like me right?
No no no
Now I’m feelin’ like
Oh ah

뜸 들이지 마요

Come on over
You know that what I‘m saying
Good night baby
